## 1. Introduction
This project involves the design, 3D printing, and assembly of a fully functional RC car, controlled by an ESP32 microcontroller. The car features a custom-designed rear differential and a rack-and-pinion steering system based on the Ackerman principle to avoid skidding. All parts are custom-designed, with the exception of a few metal machined parts where higher durability and precision were required.

## 7. Challenges and Solutions

The development of the RC car was segmented into three primary components: electronics, rear differential drive, and steering. Each component presented distinct challenges that required tailored engineering solutions.

### 7.1 Electronics
1. **Challenge**: Difficulty in establishing a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) connection between the Xbox controller and the ESP32 microcontroller.
   - **Solution**: After conducting extensive research, the Bluepad library was identified and utilized. This library provided the necessary support for BLE connections, enabling seamless communication between the Xbox controller and the ESP32.

2. **Challenge**: Arming the motor via the Xbox controller and ESP32 was problematic due to the absence of a conventional radio controller.
   - **Solution**: A script found on the [Arduino forum](https://forum.arduino.cc/t/lessons-on-arming-esc-with-arduino/427152) facilitated the identification of the correct arming PWM signals for the ESC. Implementing this script allowed for successful motor arming and control.

### 7.2 Rear Differential Drive
1. **Challenge**: The gearbox experienced displacement from the pinion gear during operation, compromising gear engagement and overall performance.
   - **Solution**: A structural enhancement was made by designing a three-arm system that extends from the chassis to apply pressure on the gearbox, maintaining optimal engagement with the pinion gear. Castor balls were integrated at the arm ends to minimize friction, facilitating smooth high-speed rotation of the ring gear.

2. **Challenge**: High stress concentrations led to frequent axle breakage.
   - **Solution**: Structural integrity was improved by introducing fillets at critical stress points behind the wheel and axle gear, promoting even stress distribution. Additionally, the infill percentage was increased, and a triangular infill pattern was adopted to enhance the axle's durability.

### 7.3 Steering System
1. **Challenge**: Determining the precise length of the steering tie rod was complex, resulting in difficulties in maintaining the steering wheels' alignment.
   - **Solution**: SolidWorks was employed to assemble the steering rack and knuckles in a virtual environment. This facilitated accurate determination of the tie rod length, ensuring consistent and correct alignment of the steering wheels.

2. **Challenge**: The tie rod had a propensity to become misaligned and rotate inwards, risking damage to the servo by causing it to lock or break during excessive rack movement.
   - **Solution**: To mitigate this issue, two structural poles were added to the chassis, acting as physical stops. These stops prevent excessive inward rotation of the tie rods, thereby safeguarding the servo from potential damage.

### Summary

By methodically addressing each engineering challenge, the RC car project achieved a robust and reliable design. The implemented solutions not only resolved the specific issues but also enhanced the car's overall performance and structural integrity, ensuring its capability to withstand various operating conditions.

## 8. Future Improvements

Looking forward, several enhancements are planned to elevate the functionality and user experience of the RC car:

1. **Integrating an IMU and OpenPilot**: To enable autonomous navigation capabilities, the integration of an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) along with the [OpenPilot](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot.git) system is proposed. This will allow the car to navigate and maneuver independently based on pre-defined parameters and real-time sensor data.

2. **Adding a First-Person Camera with Microphone**: To enhance the user experience and expand the car's applications, a first-person view (FPV) camera will be installed alongside a microphone to capture ambient sounds. This setup will enable the car to be used for inspections and monitoring in various settings such as factories, construction sites, or natural environments, providing both visual and auditory feedback.

3. **Transitioning to Radio Signal Control**: To extend the operational range and reliability of the control system, the project plans to transition from Bluetooth to radio signal-based control. This shift will allow for longer-range operation and a more stable connection, improving the carâ€™s performance in various environments.

4. **Solar-Powered Charging System**: Integrating solar panels into the car's design is planned to provide an additional power source. This could supplement the battery or allow for continuous operation in sunny conditions, increasing the car's autonomy and reducing the need for frequent battery charging.
