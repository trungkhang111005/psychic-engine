# Structure Assembly Guide

## Components Needed
### 3D-Printed Parts
- **PLA**: Chassis, bumpers, wheels, steering pinion (gyroid infill, 10-25% infill).
- **PETG**: All other components (50-75% infill, gyroid or triangle infill).

### Non-3D Printed Components
- **Bearings**: 4 x 608 2RS bearings
- **Screws**: 4 x M3x10mm screws
- **Rubber Bands**
- **Clamp**: Irwin clamp / bar clamp
- **Glue Gun**
- **Fishing line**

## Motor Compatibility
- Use a motor with a diameter between 25 mm and 29 mm, and length ? 47 mm.
- Adjust chassis file for motor diameter if outside standard range (add 0.5 mm for printing tolerance).

## 3D Printing Instructions
1. **Material Selection**:
   - **PLA**: For chassis, bumpers, wheels, steering pinion.
   - **PETG**: For all other components.

2. **Infill Settings**:
   - **PLA Parts**: 10-25% infill, gyroid for steering pinion.
   - **PETG Parts**: 50-75% infill, gyroid or triangle for strength.

3. **Printing Process**:
   - Download CAD files from the [Solidworks](SolidWorks), [.step](.step) or [.stl](.stl) folder.
   - Slice parts based on material and infill settings.
   - Print using a 3D printer with a plate size of at least 235x235 mm.

## Assembly Steps
1. **Chassis and Steering Assembly**:
   - Follow instructions in [](Assembly_Instructions/README.md) for detailed instructions.
   - Attach the steering and differential parts.

2. **Motor and Electronics Mounting**:
   - Secure motor to the chassis.
   - Integrate electronics following the [](../Electronics/README.md`).

## Testing and Adjustments
- Ensure all parts are fitted securely.
- Test mechanical components before full assembly.
